# CalendarApplication

Name: Makawitage Chehara Chamindee Perera

Time Taken: 20 hours

Note: I have used the Firebase realtime database to store the calendar events. I have set the firebase database permissions to true and access public to make it easy for you to check the database. I would attach the firebase link here.

Firebase link: "https://console.firebase.google.com/project/calendar-application-9ca4f/database/calendar-application-9ca4f-default-rtdb/data"

Screenshot of the database:
